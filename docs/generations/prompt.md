# Best prompting practices

This is one of the most important part of generating imgages. A good prompt will take your generated image to another level. Please follow the guidelines below for best prompts

- Be more descriptive for what you want. If you want blue lighting then mention that in your prompt. If you want a women to hold your product then talk about that. If you want the women look a certain way, mention it. Eg. A women with blonde bob cut holding the 'subject' under a blue light.
- Spell the text for because the model cannot read text but can generate text. So if you want to write something on your product or if the product already contains your branch name then mention that name. Eg. A women with red hair holding 'object' with text baryen writting on under red light.
