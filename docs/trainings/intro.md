# Introduction to Training Models

One of Qupine's main features is the ability to train your own models. To get started, you'll need a dataset of **10â€“20 high-quality images** that represent your target product or object. To make sure your models are trained properly please go though this document before you try training.

## Image Requirements

### Essential Criteria for Images

- **Clear focus:** The main product should be prominently visible and easy to identify.
- **Centralized subject:** The product should be the main focus of the image.

### Recommended Best Practices for Images

- **Avoid distractions:** Use images with minimal or no noisy backgrounds.
- **High resolution:** Higher-quality images lead to better results.
- **Unique images:** Avoid uploading duplicate images to meet the 20-image requirement; this will not improve results. In fact, as few as **5 unique images** can work effectively.

## Tips for Writing Effective Image Descriptions

Providing accurate and detailed descriptions for your images significantly improves model performance. Follow these guidelines:

- Clearly identify the product or object in the description.  
  **Example:** _A photo of a `shirt` with white stripes._

- Describe the product's color, design, and other defining attributes.  
  **Example:** _A photo of a `blue` shirt with `white stripes`._

- Include information about the location or setting where the product appears.  
  **Example:** _A photo of a shirt with white stripes in the `closet`._

- If the product includes any text or logos, explicitly state them.  
  **Example:** _A photo of a shirt with `Qupine` text on the chest area._
