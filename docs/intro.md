# Welcome to Qupine Documentation

Thank you for your interest in Qupine! With Qupine, you can train custom models on your products, portraits, or brands and generate stunning images using those models. Our mission is to make image generation accessible to everyone.

## How to Use Qupine

1. **Gather Images**  
   Start by collecting high-quality images of the product or subject you want to generate images for. Additionally, write descriptive captions for your images to help the model better understand the subject. Ensure the images follow our [Image Requirements Guide](#) to achieve the best results.

2. **Train Your Model**  
   Upload your images and their descriptions to train a model through our website. The training process typically takes around **19 minutes**. You can monitor the progress of your model training on the **My Models** page.

3. **Generate Images**  
   Once your model is trained, you're ready to generate images! Writing a good prompt is key to getting the best results. Check out our [Prompt Guide](#) for tips on crafting effective prompts.
